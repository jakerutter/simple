# Space Raiders

A game I made using node.js and socket.io. The game is similar to a cross between Battleship and Chess, with a space theme.

## Current Status

Once again deciding where I want to host this game. Previously had it operational in Azure, but the cost was prohibitive for a for-fun project.
Also working to have automated cypress tests for regression prevention and help speed up future development with data entry and feature testing.


### Acknowledgments

* To Ghost and Bones, my thanks for help along the way. These guys were great in assisting me with the v.1 Local Edition of this game.
