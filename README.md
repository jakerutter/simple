# Space Raiders

A game I made using node.js and socket.io. Think chess meets star trek.

## Using github for versioning of key files

When I am prepared to release I will host the game so that it is available for playing. At this time the repo is merely to help me keep these key files versioned and current.


## Acknowledgments

* To Ghost and Bones, my thanks for help along the way. These guys were great in assisting me with the v.1 Local Edition of this game.
