# Space Raiders

A game I made using node.js and socket.io. The game is similar to a cross between Battleship and Chess, with a space theme.

## Current Status

Working on this project once again.
Currently working to fix errors when updating the visible and not-visible areas of the game board to each player as units are placed and moved about the map.

### Adding automated cypress tests
These are for regression prevention and help speed up future development with data entry and feature testing. Next step on this front is to add stubs that mock a second user logging on and entering a game with the initial user. End goal is to test a game end to end with cypress tests.

### Chrome Node.js debugger
This has been a very handy tool in debugging this application.


### Acknowledgments

* To Ghost and Bones, my thanks for help along the way. These guys were great in assisting me with the v.1 Local Edition of this game.
